**Abstract:**

Biomechanics, the study of mechanical principles governing biological systems, is fundamental in understanding human movement, injury mechanisms, and rehabilitation strategies. This project delves into the intricate biomechanics of human limbs through advanced computational simulations, utilizing Fortran programming language. By developing a computational model of a simplified human limb and subjecting it to dynamic loading conditions, we aim to unravel the mechanical behaviors, stress distributions, and strain responses within the limb structure. This endeavor not only enhances our understanding of biomechanics but also showcases the potential of computational tools in elucidating complex biological phenomena and informing clinical practices.

**1. Introduction:**

Biomechanics encompasses the study of mechanical properties of biological systems, providing insights into how forces and stresses influence the structure and function of living organisms. Human limbs, consisting of bones, muscles, ligaments, and soft tissues, exhibit complex mechanical behaviors during various activities. Computational simulations offer a powerful approach to investigate these dynamics, allowing researchers to explore the interactions between different tissues and understand the underlying biomechanical principles governing human movement.

**2. Objectives:**

- Develop a computational model of a human limb using Fortran programming language.
- Simulate the mechanical response of the limb under dynamic loading conditions, such as walking, running, and jumping.
- Analyze stress and strain distributions within the limb structure to identify critical regions and assess mechanical integrity.
- Validate the computational model against experimental data or established biomechanical principles.
- Explore potential applications of the computational model in orthopedic biomechanics, sports science, and rehabilitation engineering.

**3. Methodology:**

- **Geometry and Mesh Generation:** Utilize anatomical data to create a simplified 3D model of the human limb and discretize it into finite elements for numerical simulation.
- **Material Properties:** Assign appropriate material properties (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) to different tissues based on literature values or experimental data.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Apply physiological constraints and external loading scenarios to mimic realistic biomechanical conditions.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Implement time-stepping algorithms (e.g., Newmark-beta method) to solve the equations of motion and simulate the dynamic response of the limb.
- **Stress-Strain Analysis:** Calculate stress and strain distributions within the limb structure using finite element analysis techniques.
- **Validation:** Compare simulation results with experimental measurements or established biomechanical models to validate the accuracy and reliability of the computational approach.

**4. Expected Outcomes:**
