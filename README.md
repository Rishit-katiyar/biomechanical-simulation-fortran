# biomechanical-simulation-fortran
A comprehensive biomechanical simulation of the human body using Fortran, focusing on the mechanical behavior of bones, muscles, and joints under various physical conditions. This project utilizes finite element analysis (FEA) to model stress and strain in a 2D human limb subjected to dynamic loads.
