Welcome to the Biomechanical Simulation using Fortran repository! This project offers an in-depth exploration of the human body's biomechanics, with a specific focus on modeling the mechanical behavior of bones, muscles, and joints. By leveraging the power of Fortran programming language and finite element analysis (FEA) techniques, we aim to simulate and analyze the stress and strain distribution within a 2D human limb subjected to dynamic loading conditions.

## Introduction

Biomechanics is the interdisciplinary field that integrates principles of mechanics with those of biology to understand the mechanical behavior of living organisms. In the context of human limbs, biomechanics plays a crucial role in elucidating how forces and stresses affect bones, muscles, and joints during various activities such as walking, running, and jumping. This project aims to provide a computational framework for exploring and analyzing these biomechanical dynamics in a simulated environment.

## Biological Background

**Bones:** The skeletal system serves as the structural framework of the human body, providing support, protection, and mobility. Bones are dynamic tissues composed of cells, collagen fibers, and mineralized matrix (mainly calcium phosphate). The arrangement of these components gives bones their remarkable strength and resilience. Bone biomechanics involve the study of how bones respond to mechanical forces, including deformation, stress distribution, and remodeling.

**Muscles:** Muscles are the contractile tissues responsible for generating force and producing movement. Skeletal muscles, attached to bones via tendons, play a vital role in locomotion, posture, and stability. Muscle function is influenced by various factors, including muscle architecture, fiber type composition, and neuromuscular control. Biomechanical analysis of muscles involves studying their force-generating capacity, length-tension relationship, and energy consumption during activity.

**Joints:** Joints are the points of articulation between bones, allowing for movement and flexibility. Different types of joints (e.g., ball-and-socket, hinge, pivot) facilitate specific movements and range of motion. Joint biomechanics encompasses the study of joint stability, lubrication, and load distribution. Factors such as cartilage thickness, synovial fluid viscosity, and ligamentous support contribute to joint integrity and function.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Simulation:** Our simulation framework provides a holistic representation of human limb biomechanics, incorporating the mechanical behavior of bones, muscles, and joints.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA):** Utilizing FEA techniques, we model the stress and strain distribution within the limb structure under dynamic loading conditions.
- **Customization:** Users can customize simulation parameters such as material properties, boundary conditions, and loading scenarios to explore specific biomechanical phenomena.
- **Visualization:** Simulation results are visualized through graphical representations, allowing users to analyze stress and strain patterns and gain insights into biomechanical responses.
- **Validation:** We validate our simulation results against experimental data or established biomechanical models to ensure accuracy and reliability.
